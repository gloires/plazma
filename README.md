## Installation Guidelines
Use the flutter run command to run your Flutter app on a connected device or simulator.

To run your app from the command-line:

Open a terminal and change directories to the root of your app (the same directory that contains the ```pubspec.yaml``` file for your project).

Run the following command. Once the flutter tool is running, if you change the appâ€™s source code, you can hit r to hot-reload your application (updating the source on the fly without actually restarting the entire app).

```$ cd myapp``` ```$ flutter run```

If more than one device is connected, use the flutter devices command to get their IDs, and then ```flutter run -d deviceID``` to run your app.
